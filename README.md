# YelpCamp
Yelp clone for campsites

This project explores many techniques that are required for modern web applications.
YelpCamp is a website where users may browse other user-created campsites anonymously in order to see comments, 
location, price, ratings, and a picture.
The website also supports the ability for users to create an account so that they may publicly post comments 
and create/edit their own campsite pages.

Everything on the site is functional including a permanent web address through heroku, cloud database through MongoDB Atlas, 
cloud image hosting through cloudinary, map generation through GoogleMaps API, and password recovery.

*This website was created as a capstone project for an online web developer course. All code was written by me (no copy and paste),
but the structure, logic, and style of the website were predefined.*
